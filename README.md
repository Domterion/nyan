### Explanation

Nyan is an RPG bot. In this RPG you are a cat in a strange new home. No idea where you are or of your surroundings. Your goal is to achieve what others cant and climb the leaderboards. In your adventures in this new space you can collect treats, the bots currency. A few fights along the way but nothing you cant do... join us in this adventure!

**Characters**... cats

**Currency**..... treats

**Objective**.... top the leaderboards and be the best cat out there

To get started run the `create [color] [name]` command replacing `color` and `name` with their respective attributes. The color can be `grey`, `white` or `brown`. You can pick any name for your cat so long as its less than 32 characters. When making your cat theres a chance it may be born with [heterochromia](https://allaboutcats.com/heterochromia-in-cats), this chance is 1/100.
